I'm a student who loves building cool stuff, as well as learning how other cool things work.

- ðŸŒ± Currently studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking into building a portfolio site...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about working in the public service as a software engineering intern!
- âš¡ Fun fact: `orbitalsqwib` is an intentional misspelling of `orbitalsquid` so i can keep the namespace for cheaper...

Here's some cool stuff I've built over my academic career:
 - [OrbitEngine](https://github.com/orbitalsqwib/orbitengine), a game engine based on the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) programming paradigm, built in C++ and DirectX.
 - [ThreadApp](https://github.com/orbitalsqwib/MAD-2020-threadapp), a proof-of-concept Android application built in Java with a group of friends.

Here's some more cool stuff I've worked on during my internships (FOSS, of course.):
 - [open-org-license-scanner](https://github.com/opengovsg/open-org-license-scanner), a simple way to scan an org's repos for licenses-of-concern for your policy team to review.
 - [redeem-ce](https://github.com/opengovsg/redeem-ce), a repackaging of RedeemSG (a voucher distribution and redemption system) intended for a global audience.
